Reporting bugs against mdadm
============================
Before reporting bugs against mdadm, please read the README documents, as well
as the FAQ in /usr/share/doc/mdadm . Most issues that are reported against the
mdadm package are adequately answered therein.

In particular, please do not file bugs about mdadm assembling arrays too
early, e.g. when the driver is not yet ready and device nodes do not exist.
Check FAQ item 27 about use of the rootdelay parameter instead.

Also, please check out http://bugs.debian.org/mdadm and make sure that the
issue you are facing has not already been reported.

If you are not sure that the answer you are seeking is in those files, or you
are not sure that you are facing a genuine bug, please approach
debian-user@lists.debian.org or linux-raid@vger.kernel.org with your
question(s).

Gathering information relevant to mdadm as root
===============================================
If you are not reporting bugs as root (which you should not), you will be
prompted to give permission to run a script to collect relevant information
from your system as the root user. Only the root user has access to some
information that might be relevant to the bug report you are about to file.

** Please give permission to run the script as root when asked momentarily.

If you would rather obtain the same information manually, you can run
  /usr/share/bug/mdadm/script 3>&1
as root and include or attach the output.
