debian mdadm TODO list
======================

- version-1 is a nightmare. E.g. on partitionable arrays, with / on
  /dev/md_d0p3, mdadm -Es ignores /dev/md_d0 and just uses the name, so
  /dev/md/<arrayname>.
- figure out something about device names.
- (better) udev integration

- check whether mdadm.conf and system are consistent during initramfs creation
  and fail otherwise (#381303).
- add code to compare existing and expected configuration, after standardising
  the files. In most cases, we'll have to answer DUNNO as to whether the
  existing configuration file is okay, but I guess in some cases we can
  determine that the configuration is okay. A conservative approach would be
  beneficial to the user. Not sure if it's worth the effort though.
- one nice^W important thing would be to check device names and UUIDs at least.

- verify operation without udev
  - udev removed before mdadm installed
  - udev removed after mdadm installed

- more granular handling of init.d starts/stops, don't force all arrays to be
  started.
- let user specify when to start/stop which array (#398310).
- also only stop those array we started; this can be easily done with
  sentinels in $STATEDIR

- manage DAEMON_OPTIONS with debconf
