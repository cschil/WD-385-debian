Package: darktable
Description-md5: e032162292249abbe68076444d6959cc
Description-en: virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers
 Darktable manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view
 them  through a zoomable lighttable. it also enables you to develop raw
 images and enhance them.
 .
 It tries to fill the gap between the many excellent existing free
 raw converters and image management tools (such as ufraw or f-spot).
 The user interface is built around efficient caching of image metadata and
 mipmaps, all stored in a database. the user will always be able to interact,
 even if the full resolution image is not yet loaded.
 .
 All editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached image
 buffers for display. the full image is only converted during export. The
 frontend is written in gtk+/cairo, the database uses sqlite3, raw image
 loading is done using libraw, high-dynamic range, and standard image formats
 such as jpeg are also supported. The core operates completely on floating
 point values, so darktable can not only be used for photography but also for
 scientifically acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic range).

Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (library)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

Description-en: Logbook system to manage notes through a Web interface
 The Electronic Logbook (ELOG) provides a Web interface to manage notes.  Its
 general purpose is to make it easy for people to put and access information
 online; in the form of short, time stamped text messages with optional HTML
 markup for presentation, and optional file attachments.  ELOG has its own
 daemon, there is no need for a full-fledged server (e.g. Apache).  It stores
 notes as simple as plain text; no special formatting.  Its features:
 .
   * Personal logbooks: Personal notes can be written into ELOG and can then be
     retrieved from anywhere with a Web browser.
   * Shared logbooks: Logbooks can be shared by several people, for reading and
     optionally for writing.  Work groups can share and exchange information
     like in a (simplified) news group.
   * Small databases: Since arbitrary attributes can be defined for a logbook,
     it can be used as a small database with search facilities.
   * Problem collections: A system can consist of two logbooks, in one of which
     users enter bugs or problems.  Whenever someone adds a problem, an email
     is automatically sent to the administrator.
   * Shift logbooks: If the Allow delete and Allow edit flags are off, an entry
     cannot be modified once it's been entered.  This can be useful for shift
     logbooks for example in Physics experiments where each entry becomes a
     "document" with a time and author stamp.
   * File collections: Since files can be attached to ELOG entries, the system
     can be used to store and retrieve files.

 lists, including archiving, mail <-> news gateways, and so on.  It
 has all of the features you expect from such a product, plus
 integrated support for the web (including web based archiving),
 automated bounce handling and integrated spam prevention.

Package: memcached
Description-md5: f7b1936bf072e208b59db960aca4de8a
Description-en: high-performance memory object caching system
 Danga Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of LiveJournal.com,
 a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1
 million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of database servers.
 memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page
 load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the
 databases on a memcache miss.
 .
 memcached optimizes specific high-load serving applications that are designed
 to take advantage of its versatile no-locking memory access system. Clients
 are available in several different programming languages, to suit the needs
 of the specific application. Traditionally this has been used in mod_perl
 apps to avoid storing large chunks of data in Apache memory, and to share
 this burden across several machines.

Package: minissdpd
Description-md5: 3dd0e4ad410068e63a26f5f00889c896
Description-en: keep memory of all UPnP devices that announced themselves
 MiniSSDPd is a small daemon used by MiniUPnPc (a UPnP control point for IGD
 devices) to speed up device discoveries. MiniSSDPd keeps memory of all UPnP
 devices that announced themselves on the network through SSDP NOTIFY packets.
 MiniSSDPd also has the ability to handle all SSDP traffic received on a
 computer via the multicast group 239.255.255.250:1900.
 .
 MiniSSDPd receives NOTIFY packets and stores information contained for later
 use by UPnP Control Points on the machine. MiniSSDPd receives M-SEARCH packets
 and answers on behalf of the UPnP devices running on the machine. MiniUPnPd
 and MiniUPnPc are designed to take automatically advantage of MiniSSDPd
 running on the same computer. Just make sure that MiniSSDPd is started before
 any other UPnP program on the computer.

 Network Block Device (NBD) is a client/server protocol that
 emulates a block device (such as a hard disk, a floppy, or a CD-ROM)
 over the network, thus giving the system the ability to swap over the
 network, or to use raw network disk space for other purposes.
 .

 simultaneously is not recommended, and would probably result in data
 loss. If you want multiple clients to share a remote resource, use a
 network file system such as NFS or Coda.

 Potrace can currently produce the following output formats: EPS,
 PostScript, PDF, SVG (scalable vector graphics), DXF, GeoJSON, PGM
 (for easy antialiasing of pixel-based images), Gimppath, and
 XFig. Additional backends might be added in the future.

 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Package: tor-geoipdb
Description-md5: d0b50c9cd91157b8c85856fd55e26d14
Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.
