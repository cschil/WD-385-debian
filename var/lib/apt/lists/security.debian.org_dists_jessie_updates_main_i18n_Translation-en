 This package provides the git cvsimport, cvsexportcommit, and cvsserver
 tools, which allow Git to read from and write to CVS repositories and
 offer access over CVS protocol to Git repositories.
 .
 The git cvsimport tool can incrementally import from a repository that
 is being actively developed and only requires remote access over CVS
 protocol. Unfortunately, in many situations the import leads to
 incorrect results. For reliable, one-shot imports, cvs2git from the
 cvs2svn package or parsecvs may be a better fit.

 .
  * git.el:
 .
    Status manager that displays the state of all the files of the
    project and provides easy access to the most frequently used git
    commands. The user interface is intended to be similar to the
    pcl-cvs mode. It can be started with `M-x git-status'.
 .
  * git-blame.el:
 .
    Emacs implementation of incremental "git blame".  When you turn it
    on while viewing a file, the editor buffer will be updated by
    setting the background of individual lines to a color that reflects
    which commit it comes from.
 .

Description-en: Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts -- library
 Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts" capable
 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 ..
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

 The libarchive library provides a flexible interface for reading and writing
 archives in various formats such as tar and cpio. libarchive also supports
 reading and writing archives compressed using various compression filters such
 as gzip and bzip2. The library is inherently stream-oriented; readers serially
 iterate through the archive, writers serially add things to the archive.
 .
 Archive formats supported are:
 .
    * tar (read and write, including GNU extensions)
    * pax (read and write, including GNU and star extensions)
    * cpio (read and write, including odc and newc variants)
    * iso9660 (read and write, including Joliet and Rockridge extensions, with
      some limitations)

    * mtree (read and write)
    * shar (write only)
    * ar (read and write, including BSD and GNU/SysV variants)
    * empty (read only; in particular, note that no other format will accept an
      empty file)
    * raw (read only)
    * xar (read only)
    * rar (read only, with some limitations)
    * 7zip (read and write, with some limitations)

 The Java Collections Framework was a major addition in JDK 1.2. It added many
 powerful data structures that accelerate development of most significant Java
 applications. Since that time it has become the recognised standard for
 collection handling in Java.
 .

 interfaces, implementations and utilities. There are many features, including:
 .
  * Bag interface for collections that have a number of copies of each object
  * BidiMap interface for maps that can be looked up from value to key as well
    and key to value
  * MapIterator interface to provide simple and quick iteration over maps
  * Transforming decorators that alter each object as it is added to the
    collection
  * Composite collections that make multiple collections look like one
  * Ordered maps and sets that retain the order elements are added in,
    including an LRU based map
  * Reference map that allows keys and/or values to be garbage collected under
    close control
  * Many comparator implementations
  * Many iterator implementations
  * Adapter classes from array and enumerations to collections
  * Utilities to test or create typical set-theory properties of collections
    such as union, intersection, and closure

Package: libmime-encwords-perl
Description-md5: ac8fca2903bc6cb4eba07dcc84ea629f

 MIME::EncWords is a module providing several utilities to encode and decode
 arbitrary text in RFC 2047 (formerly RFC 1522) format. The MIME standard gives
 users the ability to represent any characters in any character set by using
 special sequences like:
 .
  =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Keld_J=F8rn_Simonsen?=
 .
 There are various modules available to manipulate these special character
 sequences. This module bears most resemblance to the MIME::Words module and
 provides a similar interface, providing for relatively painless upgrading,
 while having stricter conformance to the aforementioned RFCs. It provides
 more flexibility than MIME::WordDecoder because characters can be mapped
 into any desired encoding, rather than simply the local system representation.

Description-en: Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again
 The features of the XStream library are:
 .
  - Ease of use. A high level facade is supplied that simplifies common
    use cases.
  - No mappings required. Most objects can be serialized without need
    for specifying mappings.
  - Performance. Speed and low memory footprint are a crucial part of
    the design, making it suitable for large object graphs or systems
    with high message throughput.
  - Clean XML. No information is duplicated that can be obtained via
    reflection. This results in XML that is easier to read for humans
    and more compact than native Java serialization.
  - Requires no modifications to objects. Serializes internal fields,
    including private and final. Supports non-public and inner classes.
    Classes are not required to have default constructor.
  - Full object graph support. Duplicate references encountered in the
    object-model will be maintained. Supports circular references.
  - Integrates with other XML APIs. By implementing an interface,
    XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree structure (not just
    XML).
  - Customizable conversion strategies. Strategies can be registered
    allowing customization of how particular types are represented as
    XML.
  - Error messages. When an exception occurs due to malformed XML,
    detailed diagnostics are provided to help isolate and fix the
    problem.
  - Alternative output format. The modular design allows other output
    formats. XStream ships currently with JSON support and morphing.

Description-en: Metadata anonymisation toolkit
 Metadata consist of information that characterizes data. Metadata are
 used to provide documentation for data products. In essence, metadata
 answer who, what, when, where, why, and how about every facet of the
 data that are being documented.
 .
 Metadata within a file can tell a lot about you. Cameras record data
 about when a picture was taken and what camera was used. Office
 documents like PDF or Office automatically adds author and company
 information to documents and spreadsheets.
 .
 Maybe you don't want to disclose those information on the web.
 .
 Mat only removes metadata from your files, it does not anonymise their
 content, nor can it handle watermarking, steganography, or any too
 custom metadata field/system.
 .
 If you really want to be anonym, use format that does not contain any
 metadata, or better: use plain-text.
 .
 Formats supported to some extent are:
    - Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
    - JPEG (.jpeg, .jpg, ...)

 Danga Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of LiveJournal.com,
 a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1
 million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of database servers.
 memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page
 load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the
 databases on a memcache miss.
 .
 memcached optimizes specific high-load serving applications that are designed
 to take advantage of its versatile no-locking memory access system. Clients
 are available in several different programming languages, to suit the needs
 of the specific application. Traditionally this has been used in mod_perl
 apps to avoid storing large chunks of data in Apache memory, and to share
 this burden across several machines.

Description-en: Network Time Protocol daemon and utility programs
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 This package contains the NTP daemon and utility programs.  An NTP
 daemon needs to be running on each host that is to have its clock
 accuracy controlled by NTP.  The same NTP daemon is also used to
 provide NTP service to other hosts.
 .

Description-en: client for setting system time from NTP servers
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpdate is a simple NTP client that sets a system's clock to match
 the time obtained by communicating with one or more NTP servers.  It
 is not sufficient, however, for maintaining an accurate clock in the
 long run.  ntpdate by itself is useful for occasionally setting the
 time on machines that do not have full-time network access, such as
 laptops.
 .
 If the full NTP daemon from the package "ntp" is installed, then
 ntpdate is not necessary.

Description-en: Off-the-Record Messaging plugin for Pidgin
 OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing:
  - Encryption
    - No one else can read your instant messages.
  - Authentication
    - You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
  - Deniability
    - The messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are
      checkable by a third party.  Anyone can forge messages after a
      conversation to make them look like they came from you.  However,
      _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages
      they see are authentic and unmodified.
  - Perfect forward secrecy
    - If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation
      is compromised.
 .
 This is a Pidgin plugin which implements Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging.

 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Package: swift-plugin-s3
Description-md5: 15bf1cb70e2a31606d70572f68f24d76
Description-en: swift3 (S3 compatibility) middleware plugin for swift
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) creates redundant, scalable object
 storage using clusters of standardized servers to store petabytes of
 accessible data. It is not a file system or real-time data storage system, but
 rather a long-term storage system for a more permanent type of static data
 that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then updated if necessary. Primary
 examples of data that best fit this type of storage model are virtual machine
 images, photo storage, email storage and backup archiving. Having no central
 "brain" or master point of control provides greater scalability, redundancy
 and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides the Swift3 Middleware plugin for OpenStack Swift,
 allowing access to OpenStack swift via the Amazon S3 API.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Package: tor-dbg
Description-md5: e8a546d3317d374b2fe6f8a245b9e653
Description-en: debugging symbols for Tor
 This package provides the debugging symbols for Tor, The Onion Router.
 Those symbols allow your debugger to assign names to your backtraces, which
 makes it somewhat easier to interpret core dumps.

Package: tor-geoipdb
Description-md5: d0b50c9cd91157b8c85856fd55e26d14
Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

Package: xymon
Description-md5: 6c378b0b8740b9c06232df19722e4942
Description-en: monitoring system for systems, networks and applications
 Xymon (previously called Hobbit) is a network- and applications-
 monitoring system designed for use in large-scale networks. But it will
 also work just fine on a small network with just a few nodes. It is
 low-overhead and high-performance, with an easy to use web front-end.
 .
 Network services are monitored remotely. Machine health and
 statistics are monitored through a locally installed client package
 (xymon-client). Additional (remote as well as local) checks are
 available in the package hobbit-plugins.
 .
 Alerts can trigger when monitoring detects a problem, resulting in
 e-mails or calls to your pager or mobile phone.
 .
 Xymon has a great deal of inspiration from the non-free Big Brother
 package, but does not include any Big Brother code.
