Package: dynare-matlab
Description-md5: 90e8fcabb135fcf60e09f0be51774946
Description-en: MATLAB support for Dynare
 Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in
 particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping
 generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on
 the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations
 about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able
 to handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme,
 models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme,
 models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the
 state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning
 process. In terms of types of agents, models solved by Dynare can incorporate
 consumers, productive firms, governments, monetary authorities, investors and
 financial intermediaries. Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by
 including several distinct classes of agents in each of the aforementioned
 agent categories.
 .
 Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these models. It
 is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration of the model
 parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters given a dataset. In
 practice, the user will write a text file containing the list of model
 variables, the dynamic equations linking these variables together, the
 computing tasks to be performed and the desired graphical or numerical
 outputs.
 .
 This package is only useful to users having MATLAB installed on their
 machine. It contains the source of the MEX files and will recompile them using
 the existing MATLAB installation.

 Terrans, has developed means for space traveling, further fueled
 by the discovery of subspace which makes interstellar travel not
 only possible but also fast and easy. As a result the Terrans have
 expanded their territory, eventually encountering another bipedal,
 sentient species; the Vasudans. However, due to cultural differences
 and difficulties in communicating with each other, the Galactic Terran
 Alliance (GTA) and the Parliamentary Vasudan Empire (PVE) end up fighting
 a war that lasts for 14 years.

 only some adapters really need a firmware file and that firmware files are
 not completely free (in the sense of freely redistributable), that's why
 this package exists.

 .
 The downloaded file will be used as-is by the 2.6.31 kernel. If you
 have an earlier kernel you will have to install the
 linux-wlan-ng-firmware package instead.

Package: python-pycuda
Description-md5: 999e10331c8e1f852d56bf92b2010d4b
Description-en: Python module to access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API
 PyCUDA lets you access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API from Python.
 Several wrappers of the CUDA API already exist–so what’s so special about
 PyCUDA?
  * Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom, often called
    RAII in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and crash-free
    code.  PyCUDA knows about dependencies, too, so (for example) it won’t
    detach from a context before all memory allocated in it is also freed.
  * Convenience. Abstractions like pycuda.driver.SourceModule and
    pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray make CUDA programming even more convenient than
    with Nvidia’s C-based runtime.
  * Completeness. PyCUDA puts the full power of CUDA’s driver API at your
    disposal, if you wish.
  * Automatic Error Checking. All CUDA errors are automatically translated
    into Python exceptions.
  * Speed. PyCUDA’s base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties
    above are virtually free.
  * Helpful Documentation.

 maker and 3D game design program. It is currently based on the Cube 2
 engine used in schools around the world that allows kids and adults to
 create their own video games, worlds, levels, adventures, and quests,
 even cooperatively. The goal is to make it accessible to kids but also
 powerful enough for full game projects.

Package: spectemu-common
Description-md5: 26bc6bd9e66de9535a2d1d86848d0e2c
Description-en: Fast 48k ZX Spectrum Emulator (common files)
 Spectemu emulates the 48k ZX Spectrum, which uses the Z80 microprocessor.
 This package contains common configuration files and utilities which are or
 can be used by either the X11 or the SVGAlib frontend.
 .
 It emulates the Z80 processor as well as the 48k Spectrum's other
 hardware: keyboard, screen, sound, tape I/O. The emulation is very
 close to the real thing, but it is still quite fast (It was reported
 to be working well on a laptop with 486 at 25MHz!). On the other hand,
 the user interface is not the best.
 .
 Features include:
    - Sound support through Linux kernel sound-card driver.
    - Snapshot saving and loading (.Z80 and .SNA format)
    - Tape emulation: loading from tape files (.TAP and .TZX format)
    - Optional quick loading of tapes.
    - Saving to tape files.
    - Separate utility to save tape files to real tape
    - Configurable with config files and from command line

 Cache and configuration files will be stored in ~/.cache/torbrowser and
 ~/.config/torbrowser.
 Each subsequent execution after installation will simply launch the most
 recent TBB. Tor Browser will be fetched, verified and unpacked each time a new
 version of TBB is released. When you open Tor Browser Launcher after an update,
 it will download the newer version of TBB for you and extract it over your old
 TBB directory in ~/.local/share/torbrowser, so you will maintain your TBB
 bookmarks.

Description-en: SDL-Port of Wolfenstein 3-D and Spear of Destiny
 Maybe it was the fact that people got to blow away Nazis. Maybe it was the
 sheer challenge of it all. For whatever reason, Wolfenstein 3-D and Spear of
 Destiny, pioneered the first-person shooter genre and brought its legendary
 creators, id Software, worldwide notoriety and numerous awards. In fact, The
 Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame recognized Wolfenstein 3D as helping to
 shape the overall direction of the computer gaming industry.
 .
 Wolf4SDL is an open-source port of id Software's classic first-person shooter
 Wolfenstein 3-D to the cross-platform multimedia library "Simple DirectMedia
 Layer (SDL)" (http://www.libsdl.org). It is meant to keep the original feel
 while taking advantage of some improvements.
 .
 The wolf4sdl game requires additional data files which are not available
 under a free license and cannot be distributed by Debian. Thus, this package
 contains no data files, but current releases of `game-data-packager' are
 able to generate suitable data packages from the publicly available
 Wolfenstein 3-D shareware episode.

Package: xtrs
Description-md5: 5d43233a12cabde2d61c0558e315c632
Description-en: emulator for TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P computers
 xtrs is an X-based emulator for the Tandy/Radio Shack line of Zilog
 Z-80-based microcomputers popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  It
 features cassette, floppy, and hard drive emulation, timer interrupt
 emulation, file import and export from the host operating system, support for
 most of the undocumented Z-80 instructions, and a built-in debugger.  Real
 floppy drives can be used, and, if an OSS-compatible sound driver is
 available, application-based sound can be played and real cassettes read and
 written directly through the sound card or via WAVE files.  Several hi-res
 graphics cards are emulated and, in Model 4/4P mode, mice are supported.
 There is also real-time clock, sound card, serial port, joystick, and CPU
 clock speedup emulation.
 .
 xtrs requires ROM images from the original machines.  The ROMs are
 copyrighted by Radio Shack and are not freely licensed.  (Exception: in Model
 4P mode, a freely licensed boot ROM included with this package can be used to
 boot a Model 4 operating system from a diskette image.)

Package: xvba-va-driver
Description-md5: a7ee3f38c8579ac24e96cea475deca02
Description-en: XvBA-based backend for VA API (AMD fglrx implementation)
 X-Video Bitstream Acceleration (XvBA), designed by AMD for its ATI/AMD Radeon
 GPU, is a future extension of the X video extension (Xv) for the X Window
 System on Linux operating-systems. XvBA API allows video programs to offload
 portions of the video decoding process to the GPU video-hardware. Currently,
 the portions designed to be offloaded by XvBA onto the GPU are motion
 compensation (mo comp) and inverse discrete cosine transform (iDCT), and VLD
 (Variable-Length Decoding) for MPEG-2, MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) and VC-1 encoded
 video.
 .
 This driver only works with the proprietary fglrx driver from AMD.
